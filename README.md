<h1><b>DE-FS ALGORITHM: DYNAMIC FEATURE ENSEMBLE EVOLUTION FOR ENHANCED FEATURE SELECTION</b></h1>


<b>Overview</b>
<p>TThe DE-FS Algorithm is an innovative feature selection technique designed to address the dynamic nature of datasets, particularly in domains like Educational Data Mining (EDM). By combining traditional feature selection methods with adaptive thresholding, the DE-FS Algorithm selects the most relevant features for classification, improving prediction accuracy and robustness.</p>

<b>Features</b>

1. Combines traditional feature selection methods (e.g., Chi-Square, Information Gain, Correlation Analysis) with dynamic thresholds.

2. Adapts to evolving data patterns through iterative evaluation and threshold adjustment.

3. Outputs an optimal feature subset that maximizes the chosen evaluation metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).

4. Suitable for diverse domains such as bioinformatics, education, and healthcare.

<b>Applications</b>

The DE-FS Algorithm can be applied to:

1. Predict student performance in educational systems.

2. Improve classification accuracy in medical diagnostics.

3. Identify key features in high-dimensional datasets for financial analytics and more.

<b>Prerequisites</b> 

1. Python 3.7 or higher
2.  Required libraries: numpy pandas scikit-learn


<b>Algorithm Workflow</b>

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the input dataset.

Initialization: Sets initial feature subset and thresholds.

Dynamic Feature Scoring: Combines multiple feature selection methods to score features.

Adaptive Thresholding: Adjusts thresholds dynamically based on performance.

Evaluation: Measures the performance of selected features using defined metrics.

Optimization: Iterates to find the best-performing feature subset.

<b>Output</b>

The optimal feature subset
