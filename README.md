#DE-FS Algorithm: Dynamic Feature Ensemble Evolution for Enhanced Feature Selection
Overview
The DE-FS Algorithm is an advanced feature selection technique designed to optimize classification performance by dynamically integrating multiple feature selection methods with adaptive thresholding. This repository contains the Python implementation of the algorithm, enabling researchers to replicate and evaluate its performance on various datasets.

Features
Combines multiple feature selection methods (e.g., Mutual Information, ANOVA).
Dynamically adjusts feature importance thresholds based on evaluation metrics.
Iteratively refines the feature subset to maximize model accuracy.
Outputs an optimal feature subset for enhanced classification performance.
Applications
The DE-FS algorithm is suitable for datasets in:

Bioinformatics
Educational Data Mining
Medical Diagnostics
Financial Analytics
Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or higher
Required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Usage
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DE-FS-Algorithm.git  
cd DE-FS-Algorithm
2. Prepare the Dataset
Place your dataset in a CSV format in the data/ directory. Ensure it has features and labels in the last column.

3. Run the Algorithm
Edit the config.py file to specify the dataset path, feature selection methods, and evaluation metrics. Then run:

bash
Copy code
python de_fs_algorithm.py
Algorithm Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the input dataset.
Initialization: Sets initial feature subset and thresholds.
Dynamic Feature Scoring: Combines multiple feature selection methods to score features.
Adaptive Thresholding: Adjusts thresholds dynamically based on performance.
Evaluation: Measures the performance of selected features using defined metrics.
Optimization: Iterates to find the best-performing feature subset.
Output
The algorithm generates:

The optimal feature subset (output/optimal_features.csv).
Evaluation metric results (output/evaluation_results.txt).
