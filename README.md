<h1><b>DE-FS ALGORITHM: DYNAMIC FEATURE ENSEMBLE EVOLUTION FOR ENHANCED FEATURE SELECTION</b></h1>


<b>Overview</b>
<p>TThe DE-FS Algorithm is an innovative feature selection technique designed to address the dynamic nature of datasets, particularly in domains like Educational Data Mining (EDM). By combining traditional feature selection methods with adaptive thresholding, the DE-FS Algorithm selects the most relevant features for classification, improving prediction accuracy and robustness.</p>

<b>Features</b>

1. Combines traditional feature selection methods (e.g., Chi-Square, Information Gain, Correlation Analysis) with dynamic thresholds.

2. Adapts to evolving data patterns through iterative evaluation and threshold adjustment.

3. Outputs an optimal feature subset that maximizes the chosen evaluation metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score).

4. Suitable for diverse domains such as bioinformatics, education, and healthcare.

<b>Applications</b>

The DE-FS Algorithm can be applied to:

1. Predict student performance in educational systems.

2. Improve classification accuracy in medical diagnostics.

3. Identify key features in high-dimensional datasets for financial analytics and more.

<b>Prerequisites</b> 

1. Python 3.7 or higher
2.  Required libraries: numpy pandas scikit-learn


<b>Algorithm Workflow</b>

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the input dataset.

Initialization: Sets initial feature subset and thresholds.

Dynamic Feature Scoring: Combines multiple feature selection methods to score features.

Adaptive Thresholding: Adjusts thresholds dynamically based on performance.

Evaluation: Measures the performance of selected features using defined metrics.

Optimization: Iterates to find the best-performing feature subset.

<b>Output</b>

The optimal feature subset

<b>To run the DE-FS algorithm code, follow these steps</b>

<b> Step 1: Set Up the Environment <b>

  Install Python:

    Make sure Python (version 3.7 or higher) is installed on your system.  If not, download and install Python from python.org.

  Install Required Libraries:

    Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

      pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib


Step 2: Prepare the Dataset

Use a Dataset:

The dataset should be in CSV format and include features (input columns) and labels (target column).

Preprocess Your Dataset:

Ensure there are no missing values.

Encode categorical variables if needed (e.g., using one-hot encoding).

Normalize or scale numeric features for consistency.




<b>Step 3: Execute the Code<b>

Run the Python Script:

    Save the DE-FS algorithm code as de_fs_algorithm.py in a folder on your system.

    Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the folder, and execute the script: python de_fs_algorithm.py


Output:

The script will display the following:

Iteration details.

Selected features for each iteration.

Performance metrics (e.g., accuracy).

Optimal feature subset indices.


<b>Step 4: Modify Parameters (Optional)<b>

Adjust Parameters:

Open the de_fs_algorithm.py file in a text editor.

Modify the parameters for your dataset:

      max_iterations = 10  # Number of iterations to run
      
      initial_threshold = 0.5  # Initial threshold for feature selection

Use Your Dataset:

Replace the synthetic dataset generation code:

      from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
      X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_informative=15, random_state=42)
With:
      
      import pandas as pd
      
      data = pd.read_csv("path/to/your_dataset.csv")
      
      X = data.iloc[:, :-1].values  # Features (all columns except the last one)
      
      y = data.iloc[:, -1].values   # Labels (last column)


Run the Script:

  Save the changes and rerun the script:

      python de_fs_algorithm.py


Step 5: Analyze Results

Optimal Features:

The script outputs the indices of selected features:

Optimal Feature Subset Indices

Use these indices to extract the selected features from your dataset.

Performance Metrics:

      Check the console for metrics like accuracy or F1-score:

          Best Performance Achieved

Optional Enhancements

Save Results:

    Modify the script to save the selected features and performance metrics to a file.
    
          Visualize Feature Importance:
          
          Use libraries like Matplotlib to plot feature importance scores or correlations.
